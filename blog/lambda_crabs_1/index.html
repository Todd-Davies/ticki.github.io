<p>This post will cover lifetimes and regions in depth, with a focus on the mathematical background of regions. That is, what is a region? What rules do they follow? How does the compiler handle them? And how are they inferred?</p>

<h2 id="regions-and-their-ordering">Regions and their ordering</h2>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s briefly investigate what a region is. A region (or in Rust lingo, a lifetime) is a span of some form, e.g. the token stream. Regions have an outlive relation defined on them.</p>

<p>A region <code>'a</code> outlives <code>'b</code> if <code>'b</code>&rsquo;s span is covered by <code>'a</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>'a: I----------------I
'b: I---------I
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see <code>'a: 'b</code> since the first span covers the second. But what is the nature of the outlives relation?</p>

<h2 id="regions-a-poset">Regions: a poset</h2>

<p>One could mistakenly believe that regions are ordered over their outlives relation. An totally ordered set A under ≤ means that any elements a, b ∈ A satisfy all of the following statements:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If a ≤ b and b ≤ a are both satisfied, a = b.</p></li>

<li><p>If a ≤ b and b ≤ c are both satisfied, a ≤ c.</p></li>

<li><p>At least one of a ≤ b and b ≤ a is true.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To see why the outlives relation is not a total order over the set of regions, consider the case:</p>

<pre><code>'a: I---------I
'b:    I------------I
</code></pre>

<p>The third condition is not met here: neither <code>'a: 'b</code> or <code>'b: 'a</code> is true.</p>

<p>It turns out that weakening the last condition to only consider reflexivity gives us a structure, that L (the set of regions) classifies. Replace 3. by a ≤ a, and you get a partially ordered set, or a poset.</p>

<h2 id="outlive-relation-as-a-partial-order">Outlive relation as a partial order</h2>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s briefly explain how the rules of outliving mirrors the rules of partial orders.</p>

<p>The first rule, the rule of antisymmetry, reads</p>

<pre><code>'a: 'b
'b: 'a
-------
'a = 'b
</code></pre>

<p>So if two regions (lifetimes, borrows, scopes, etc.) outlives each other symmetrically (&lsquo;a: &lsquo;b and &lsquo;b: &lsquo;a), they are, in fact, the same.</p>

<p>The second rule, the rule of transitivity, is crucial to understanding the semantics of regions:</p>

<pre><code>'a: 'b
'b: 'c
------
'a: 'c
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, regions are hierarchical. It might seem very simple, but the implications are in fact very important: it allows us to conclude things from transitivity. Think of it like you can &ldquo;inherit&rdquo; bounds from outliving regions.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>'a: I--------------------I
'b:   I----------------I
'c:      I---------I
</code></pre>

<p>Say we know that, <code>'a: 'b</code>, and <code>'b: 'c</code>. We can then conclude that <code>'a: 'c</code>.</p>

<p>The last rule simply states that &lsquo;a outlives itself. This might seem counterintuitive due to the odd terminology, but think of outlives as &ldquo;outlives or equals to&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In fact, there is only one more thing we know about regions: they have an unique maximal extrema, which outlives all other regions, <code>'static</code>. Namely, <code>'static</code> outlives any region, <code>'a</code>.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s all the &ldquo;axioms&rdquo; of lifetimes.</p>

<h2 id="what-subtyping-is">What subtyping is</h2>

<p>Before we go to next section, we will just have to briefly cover subtyping. τ is said to be a subtype of υ (denoted <code>τ &lt;: υ</code>), if a <em>type mismatch</em>, such that τ is inferred to be of type υ, makes the value of type τ coerce into a value of type υ.</p>

<p>In other words, you can replace your subtype by a supertype (the parent type) without getting a type mismatch error.</p>

<h2 id="regions-are-just-types-outlive-relation-as-a-subtyping-rule">Regions are just types: Outlive relation as a subtyping rule</h2>

<p>If you think about it, you may notice that lifetimes are used in type positions <em>a lot</em>. This is no coincidence, since <em>regions are just types with a subtyping relation</em>, which is the very reason you are allowed to do e.g. <code>MyStruct&lt;'a&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, the outlive relation defines a subtyping rule. That is, you can always &ldquo;shrink&rdquo; a region span. Let <em>c</em> be a type constructor, &lsquo;a → *, then &lsquo;a: &lsquo;b implies that <code>'a &lt;: 'b</code>, that is <code>'a</code> can coerce into <code>'b</code>.</p>

<p>For example, <code>&amp;'static str</code> can coerce to any <code>&amp;'a str</code>, since <code>'static</code> outlives any lifetime.</p>

<p>Due to the implementation, there are a few limits, though. You can for example not do <code>let a: 'a</code> which would be useless anyways.</p>

<p>Syntactically, there is a confusion: lifetimes appears in certain trait places, especially in <em>trait bounds</em>. But, in fact, that is only a syntactic sugar for an imaginary trait, let&rsquo;s call it <code>Scope</code>, which takes a lifetime.</p>

<p>This represents the scope of a type, so when writing <code>fn my_func::&lt;T: 'static&gt;()</code> you can think of it as writing <code>fn my_func::&lt;T: Scope&lt;'static&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Due to the coercion rules (which will be covered in a future post), this means that if <code>T: Scope&lt;'a&gt;</code> and <code>U: Scope&lt;'b&gt;</code> with <code>'a: 'b</code>, then <code>T</code> is a subtype of <code>U</code>.</p>

<h2 id="inferring-regions">Inferring regions.</h2>

<p>This is the exciting part. Rust has region inference, allowing it to infer the lifetimes in your program.</p>

<p>Due to Rust&rsquo;s aliasing guarantees, it tries to <em>minimize</em> the region&rsquo;s span, while still satisfying the conditions (outlives relations) given.</p>

<p>So, this is just a classical optimization problem:</p>

<pre><code>minimize    'a
subject to  A, B, C...
</code></pre>

<p>A, B, C&hellip; are outlives relations. <code>'a</code> may or may not be free in those.</p>

<p>We will cover how we actually solve this optimization problem in a future blog post, but until then you can see if you can find an algorithm to do so ;).</p>

<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>

<p>Credits to Yaniel on IRC for the idea for the name of this series. It is based on the famous &ldquo;lambda cats&rdquo; series, but since Ferris, the crab, is our Rust mascot, we do lambda crabs, instead.</p>
